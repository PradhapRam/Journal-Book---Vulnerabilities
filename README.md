# Journal-Book---Vulnerabilities

 # Web Security Journal Description

This journal documents my 30-day exploration into web security, conducted during the second semester of my second year as part of my Web Security module. Over the course of this project, I delved into ten critical web vulnerabilities, examining their nature, impact, and mitigation strategies. Each entry provides detailed analysis, practical examples, and personal reflections on the learning process. This journal serves as a comprehensive record of my progress and understanding in identifying and addressing web security threats.
